# Using Git in Terminal (on MacOS X) 

#### Note: Git/GitHub dcoumentation and this tutorial - https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Using-Git-with-Terminal#add-files-and-directories-to-gitignore - were used to learn how to interface between GitHub and Terminal.

## Install Git Credential Manager

```
brew install --cask git-credential-manager
```

## Update by running:

```
brew upgrade --cask git-credential-manager
```

#### The first time you perform an action that requires GitHub authorization, it will prompt a login in via a browser window. Once successfully authenticated, credentials are stored and will not need to be retyped unless credentials are changed (e.g., update password, etc.)

## Install GitHub CLI (GitHub command-line tool)

```
brew install gh
```

## Follow prompts for authentication
